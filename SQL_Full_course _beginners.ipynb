    "* `flusk`:Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries (except for some basics standard libraries such as bottom.py [3]).[4] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.[5] Flask is commonly used with MongoDB, which gives it more control over databases and history. Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest,[6] LinkedIn,[7] and the community web page for Flask itself.[8]\n",
    "* `Django`: Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ JANG-goh; stylised as django)[5] is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern.[6][7] It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and \"pluggability\" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.[8] Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.Some well-known sites that use Django include the Public Broadcasting Service,[9] Instagram,[10] Mozilla,[11] The Washington Times,[12] Disqus,[13] Bitbucket,[14] and Nextdoor.[15] It was used on Pinterest,[16] but later the site moved to a framework built over Flask.[17]\n",
